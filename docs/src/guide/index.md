title: Lookbook Overview
---

Lookbook is a tool to help develop, test and document [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org) in isolation.

It provides a UI to let you browse your component library and preview your components alongside code samples and documentation.

Lookbook is built on top of ViewComponent's native [preview classes](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/previews.html) so works out-of-the-box for new and existing projects alike.

{%= note :info do %}
**This documentation is for Lookbook v1.0+**. Documentation for older releases can be found in the [0.9.x branch of the Lookbook repo &rarr;](https://github.com/allmarkedup/lookbook/tree/0.9.x)

## Lookbook Demo

If you want to have a quick play with Lookbook, the easiest way is to [give the demo app]({{ site.data.external.demo.url }}) a spin. It's a basic Rails/ViewComponent app with a few test components included to tinker with.

[{{ site.data.external.demo.url }}]({{ site.data.external.demo.url }})

If you'd rather dig in a bit more and run the demo app locally, the [demo repo]({{ site.data.external.demo.repo }}) contains instructions on how to get it up and running.
