It's quick and easy to get up and running with Lookbook.
Follow this guide to get up and running quickly and then explore the rest of the docs to dive in deeper.

{%= note :info do %}
If you are **already using Lookbook in your project** then head over to the [upgrade guide](/guide/upgrading) instead for details on how to update to the latest version.
{% end %}

## Install Lookbook

Add Lookbook to your `Gemfile` somewhere *after* the ViewComponent gem:

```ruby
gem "view_component"
gem "lookbook"
```

and then `bundle install` to install Lookbook.

Next mount the Lookbook engine (at a path of your choosing) in your routes file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  if Rails.env.development?
    mount Lookbook::Engine, at: "/lookbook"
  end
end
```

## Add a component and preview

*You can skip this step if you are installing Lookbook into a project with existing components.*

For the purposes of this guide we'll use the [ViewComponent generator](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/generators.html#generate-a-preview) to create an example component with a corresponding preview file:

```bash
bin/rails generate component Example title --preview
```

This will generate an `ExampleComponent` class and corresponding template in `app/components`, and a `ExampleComponentPreview` [preview class](https://viewcomponent.org/guide/previews.html#previews) in `test/components/previews`.

## Open the preview in the Lookbook UI

Start the server (if it isn't already running), point your browser to `http://localhost:3000/lookbook` and click on the `Example` component link in the sidebar on the left.

You will see the component preview in the Lookbook UI. It's nothing much to look at yet but it's a good start!

## Making changes

Now let's make some changes to the component files created by the generator.

### Edit the component template

Open up the component template file at `app/components/example_component.html.erb`. The contents will look like this:

```html
<div>Add Example template here</div>
```

Edit the content of this template to make use of the `title` property that is passed into the component:

```html
<div>
  <h1><%= @title %></h1>
  <p>This is an example component</p>
</div>
```

Once the changes are saved you'll instantly be able to see the changes reflected in the Lookbook UI:

{%= note :info do %}
Any changes to component template files, component class files or preview class files will cause the preview to re-render in the UI.
{% end %}

### Edit the component preview

Now open the example component preview file at `test/components/previews/example_component_preview.rb`. The contents will look like this:

```rb
class ExampleComponentPreview < ViewComponent::Preview
  def default
    render(ExampleComponent.new(title: "title"))
  end
end
```

Make a change to the `default` preview example method to pass in a better title, and create another example method with a longer title for testing purposes.

```rb
class ExampleComponentPreview < ViewComponent::Preview
  def default
    render(ExampleComponent.new(title: "A regular title"))
  end

  def long_title
    render(ExampleComponent.new(title: "This is a really long title that we are testing with"))
  end
end
```

If you switch back to Lookbook you will see that the `Example` nav item in the sidebar now has two items nested below it, one for each example method.

You can create as many example methods as you like in order to showcase all the different possible states of your component.

## Dive deeper...

Now that you have a component preview to experiment with you can dig into the [preview docs](/guide/previews) to learn more about adding [annotations](/guide/previews/annotating), using [preview layouts](/guide/previews/layouts), [grouping examples](/guide/previews/grouping) and more.
