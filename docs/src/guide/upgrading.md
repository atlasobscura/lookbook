Upgrading to **Lookbook v1.0** from an older version is straightforward.

There are no breaking changes from the **v0.9.x** releases to **v1.0** so your existing set up should just work.

Just update the Lookbook gem version in your `Gemfile`:

```rb
gem "lookbook", "~> 1.0"
```

Then `bundle install`, start your app and that's it - you are now using the latest version of Lookbook!

to the [Github repo]({{ site.data.external.lookbook.github.home }}) and open an issue.
