  # Collapsable tabs
  # ----------------
  #
  # Tabs are rendered horizontally, unless there is not enough space to fit each one in.
  # In that case the maximum number that fit in the space are shown with the rest
  # collapsing down into a dropdown menu.
  #
  # You can see this behaviour in action by resizing the viewport down to about 350px wide in the preview above.
